# CHANGELOG

Here are the changelogs and maybe some TODOs for self-tracking of what to do:

- V1:
    - Initial Release. Nothing to see here
- V1.1:
    - Added SMD, THT, and a UNewHaven versions of the board (the last one is mainly due to how the project got started and to seperate the UNewHaven markings from the main project). The THT version will be for a soldering kit of sorts, and the SMD version will be mass production.
    - Changed the button's label to just text, as Buzzard's output is to small for a prototype fabhouse to show well.
    - Changed the NodeMCU symbol to 2 headers, so that they are exportable as 2 components in BOMs and footprint placement for assembly.
