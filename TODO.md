TODO list for the next rev, which will be V1.1:
- Add option for SMD pushbuttons
- Change BT marking to pure text due to PCB fab's tollerances on silkscreen.
- Add jumper for DP LED, I/O either connected to BT2 or to DP LED (defaults to BT screen).
    - Add silkscreen marking for on-board "instructions"
